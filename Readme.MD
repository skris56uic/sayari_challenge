# **Sayari Front End Developer Code Challenge**

## **Project Description**

This project models a simplified version of a Stack Overflow-like application. It demonstrates the use of modern front-end technologies such as **TypeScript**, **React**, **Redux**, and **React-Query** to build a scalable and maintainable application. The focus is on effective data modeling, state management, and API integration.

The application includes features such as:

- Displaying questions and answers for a specific user.
- Showing all answers for a single question.
- Adding a new answer to an existing question.
- Allows sorting of posts based on scores & time
- Allow upvoting or downvoting or posts/answers

The backend is a mock server built with **Express**, serving data from a JSON file. The project is designed to showcase technical skills, creativity, and decision-making in front-end development.
